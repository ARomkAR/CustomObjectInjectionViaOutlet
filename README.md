# CustomObjectInjectionViaOutlet
Demo app for testing Custom Object Injection as IBOutlet in storyboard in interfacebuilder.
This can be used to define view controller or view dependancy within storyboard as an outlet like view models, logic controllers, data sources etc.

Only caveat is given outlet has to be inherited from NSObject.

ToDo: 
Put some more doc and tests
